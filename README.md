# Why HP
## Introduction
While I love to ensure and enforce security meassures, the HP team relies on a security 2FA system that plain sucks by not allowing you to paste your password from your clipboard nor allows you to easily change your password (unless you're willing to contact employees departament). Of course this is an issue with an absolut critical priority so I worked nonstop to deliver a high end cutting edge solution to overcome this flaw.

That's how the **Why HP** extension was born, with this new invention we allow our users to c̸̄ͅô̷͍p̷̮͐y̷̭̓ ̶̼͑á̴̯n̶̲̅d̸͈͑ ̷͚͌p̵̱͒a̴͕̾ş̸̀t̸͈͛ẻ̴̟ their email and password on an alternative login that actually does what it should do. However, since Google Chrome security policies are a̶ ̶h̶u̶g̶e̶ ̶p̶a̶i̶n̶ not the more happy ones, the popup window kept closing itself when you focused on another window to c̷̤̑̂̈́ó̴̘̰p̶͚̈́̆͌ỵ̷͔̈͑ ̵̖̟͛͒ḁ̵̘̙̇͋̅ń̸̰̣̗ḋ̴̡̞̰͝ ̸͕͙̌̐͗p̷̡͎̳͆̂̊ȁ̷̰̋s̶̀ͅṫ̷̩͇̣͊e̶͈̗̿̑ your credentials, so we had to figure out how to tackle this new problem.
After several nights non-sleeping we finally reached a new clever solution, we could storage a copy of whatever the user enters on the email input on the extension local storage, that way we're safe in case you need to close and reopen the application. We could even reproduce this to storage the password! (improving the user experience by a lot). However if I did that I would probably be kicked out immediatly due to not caring at all about security credentials handling.

## What's coming next?
Since this is a high demanded application we had discussions with the UX team and still have not concluded whether the *Log On* button should be automatically pressed or not programatically by our application, on future versions we're are planning on adding a **checkbox** so you can choose the behaviour that better adapts to your needs!
